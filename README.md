# 🛡️ Network Protocol Vulnerability Exploration Lab

## A. Objective

The goal of this lab is to explore the vulnerabilities of common network protocols (**FTP, TELNET, SSH, HTTP**) by performing **brute force attacks** to recover passwords and then using those credentials to **sniff network traffic**. You will also analyze the **security** of these protocols and propose **mitigation strategies**.

---

## B. Lab Tasks

### 1. Enumerate the Vulnerable VM to Discover Usernames

- Identify potential usernames for brute force attacks.
- Document the usernames you find.

### 2. Perform Brute Force Attacks

#### 2.1. FTP, TELNET, and SSH
Use tools like **Hydra**, **Medusa**, or **NetExec** to perform brute force attacks against the following protocols:
- FTP  
- TELNET  
- SSH

#### 2.2. HTTP
Use **Burp Intruder** to automate brute force attacks against an HTTP login page.
- Configure Intruder to test a list of usernames and passwords.
- Analyze the results to identify successful logins.

---

### 3. Sniff Network Traffic

- Use the recovered credentials to log in to the respective services.
- Use **Wireshark** or **tcpdump** to capture and analyze network traffic during the session.
- Identify which protocols transmit data in plaintext and which use encryption.
- Provide evidence (e.g., **screenshots**) to prove which protocols are secure and which are not.

---

### 4. Analyze Problems Encountered

- Were there any issues during the brute force attacks? (e.g., rate limiting, protocol-specific challenges)
- How did you resolve these issues?

---

### 5. Propose Mitigation Strategies

- For each vulnerable protocol, propose a secure alternative.
- Explain how these alternatives mitigate the vulnerabilities.

---

### 6. Write a Walkthrough

Document your entire process in a **walkthrough format**. Include:
- Tools used  
- Commands executed  
- Screenshots of key steps  
- Analysis of results  
- Mitigation strategies

---

## C. Deliverables

- **Walkthrough Document**: A detailed Markdown file documenting your process, results, and analysis.
- **Evidence**: Screenshots of brute force attacks, packet captures, and successful logins.
- **GitHub Repository**: Push the walkthrough and evidence to your public GitHub repository.
- **Demo and Debrief**: A 5–15 minute live demo and presentation of your findings.

---

## D. Demo and Debrief

Each student will perform a **5–15 minute live demo** of their lab work, including:

- A brief explanation of the tools and techniques used  
- A demonstration of the brute force attack and sniffing process  
- A summary of findings and mitigation strategies  

> The debrief will assess your understanding of the topic while enhancing your public speaking and presentation skills.

---

## E. Submission Instructions

1. Create a **public GitHub repository**.
2. Push your walkthrough (in **Markdown** format) and **evidence (screenshots)** to the repository.
3. Submit the **repository link** to your instructor.
4. Be prepared to deliver a **live demo and debrief** during the lab session.
